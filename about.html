      <h2>History of Bicycles</h2>
      <p>The bicycle was introduced in the 19th century in Europe. By the early 21st century, there were more than 1 billion bicycles. Bicycles are the principal means of
         transport in many regions. They also provide a popular form of recreation, and have been adapted for use as children's toys. Bicycles are used for fitness, military
          and police applications, courier services, bicycle racing, and artistic cycling.

          <h2>Types of Bicycles </h2>
          <p>Bicycles can be categorized in many different ways: by function, by number of riders, by general construction, by gearing or by means of propulsion. 
            The more common types include utility bicycles, mountain bicycles, racing bicycles, touring bicycles, hybrid bicycles, cruiser bicycles, and BMX bikes.
             Less common are tandems, low riders, tall bikes, fixed gear, folding models, amphibious bicycles, cargo bikes, recumbents and electric bicycles.</p>

          <h2>Environmental Impact</h2>
          <p>One of the profound economic implications of bicycle use is that it liberates the user from motor fuel consumption. (Ballantine, 1972) The bicycle is 
            an inexpensive, fast, healthy and environmentally friendly mode of transport. Ivan Illich stated that bicycle use extended the usable physical environment 
            for people, while alternatives such as cars and motorways degraded and confined people's environment and mobility. Currently, two billion bicycles are 
            in use around the world. Children, students, professionals, laborers, civil servants and seniors are pedaling around their communities. They all experience 
            the freedom and the natural opportunity for exercise that the bicycle easily provides. Bicycle also has lowest carbon intensity of travel.</p>
